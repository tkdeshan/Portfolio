    description:
      "This power supply features a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to obtain variable voltages up to 12 V with 0.1 V resolution. It can measure resistor values and plot I-V characteristic curves for electronic components like resistors, diodes, and transistors. The GUI facilitates command input and output display, including measured values and I-V curves.",
